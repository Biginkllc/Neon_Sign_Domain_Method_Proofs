## What NSDM Is

The Neon Sign Domain Method (NSDM) is a way to visualize domain names as *real-world neon or LED signage* before sale or licensing.

Instead of only listing domains as plain text, NSDM presents them as realistic storefront, window, or building signs. These visual prototypes help buyers — such as pawnshops, jewelry stores, sign makers, auction houses, galleries, and Web3 brands — picture how a domain will look in the physical world.

## Origin Story

While reviewing my Unstoppable Domains portfolio, I focused on **14kwith.crypto** (purchased 07/01/2022) and imagined it flashing in a pawnshop window as an upgrade from the common “We Buy Gold” signs.

From there, the idea expanded:

- **14kwith.crypto → 24kwith.crypto** for higher-end precious metal buyers  
- Extending the concept to **sign-making companies** as a ready-made design pipeline  
- Scaling up to **giant auction houses** (Sotheby’s, Christie’s) using domain-based neon branding  
- Exploring **crypto-chain-specific endings** (.bitcoin, .ltc, .bch, etc.) for retail signage and leasing

This repository documents that concept and its early visual prototypes as proof-of-prior vision.

## Purpose of This Repository

- To timestamp the Neon Sign Domain Method (NSDM) as my original concept  
- To collect example neon sign prototypes for specific domains  
- To describe business models: domain sales, signage commissions, and leasing  
- To provide a reference for potential collaborators, buyers, and sign manufacturers

## Example Vertical Packs (Initial Focus)

1. **Precious Metals & Pawnshops**  
   Domains such as `14kwith.crypto` and `24kwith.crypto` visualized as pawnshop window neon.

2. **Crypto-Branded Retail Signage**  
   Domains using endings like `.bitcoin`, `.ltc`, `.bch` for shops, ATMs, and service providers.

3. **Auction Houses & Galleries**  
   Domains designed as exterior building signage or event branding for high-end auctions.

Additional verticals (bars, clubs, cannabis, photography galleries, etc.) may be added over time.
